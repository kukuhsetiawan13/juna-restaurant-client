Before you run the client, please change the `baseUrl` file in the store folder > baseUrl.js according to your local IP. To find your local IP, you can type `ifconfig` in the terminal (you can also watch my video).

Please make sure that the server is running and the `baseUrl.js` has been configured, then you can run `npm start` to run the client.
