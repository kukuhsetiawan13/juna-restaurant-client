# juna-restaurant-client

Before you run the client, please change the `baseUrl` file in the store folder > baseUrl.js according to your local IP. To find your local IP, you can type `ifconfig` in the terminal (you can also watch my video).

Please make sure that the server is running and the `baseUrl.js` has been configured, then you can run `npm start` to run the client.

&nbsp;
If client can't connect with localhost ip address, please change the base url to the link below (deployed server link). APK and Expo Publish link have already used deployed server.
- Link Deployed Server: http://54.208.76.230



## IMPORTANT
If somehow the APK file or the local app doesn't run well, you can download `Expo Go` from Playstore and scan the QR Code from this link `https://expo.dev/@kukuhsetiawan.13/client?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go` to test the application (it is the same app that has been published, and it is connected to the deployed server)
